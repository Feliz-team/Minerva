# DataBase files
- [DB deployment script](DB_deployment_script.sql) - use it on a clean new database to create all the tables and relationships to run this script, just run it as a SQL query.
- [insert-example-data.sql](insert-example-data.sql) - use it to insert example data in db and test how it works. Currently inserts only into Accounts and Account_types.
